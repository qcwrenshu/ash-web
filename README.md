Ash Web: Web application for [Ash 2](https://github.com/qcwrenshu/ash-public) (Discord bot for StormLands)

(never finished!)

Written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Express on Node.js), GraphQL

using React, Babel, Webpack, Apollo

(@qcwrenshu turnip)

# Features

- React-based single page application
- GraphQL server
- Search system
- Streamlined design

# Getting started

Assuming Ash Public is already installed:

1) Move `web` into the root directory of Ash Public
2) Require `web/index.js` from the root `index.js` after all modules have been loaded
3) Overwrite the `package.json` with that from this repository
4) Run `npm install` to install dependencies and dev dependencies
5) Build once (see instructions below)
6) Run `index.js` to start Ash

# Build

Run `npx webpack` or `npm run build` after updating scripts in `src`.

This compiles the scripts and places them in `public/scripts`.

# For more information

For more information, see the comments at the top of each file.
